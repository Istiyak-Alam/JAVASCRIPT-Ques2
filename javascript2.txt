Q 6 :- Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language?

Answwer :- JavaScript's dynamic nature is due to its ability to handle and manipulate data at runtime.
           Here are a few reasons why JavaScript is dynamic:
           1.JavaScript allows us to define and create new variables at any time during the code execution.
           2.We can change the type of a variable after it has been declared.
           3.JavaScript allows for dynamic modification of object structures, with the ability to add or remove properties and methods from objects during runtime.
